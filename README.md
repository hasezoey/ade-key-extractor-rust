# ADE key extractor rust

TODO

## Motivation

This Project was created as a test to see if i could convert the [Python Script](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools/blob/master/DeDRM_plugin/adobekey.py) to a rust project, because wine somehow didnt allow me to install python 3 and in python 2 wouldnt let me install pycrypto.

## Usage
